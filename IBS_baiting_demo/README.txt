README for gedmatch figures & emails

The files marked GEDmatch_*_Redacted.pdf are printouts of the display of the GEDmatch 1-to-1 match genome browser. The colour key did not print out so a screenshot is saved out in GEDmatch_ColourKey_Screenshot.png


Each file is a match between a target and bait kit. The first 3 files are T1 matches with B1, B2, and Bmis. The next 3 files (3-6) the matches for T2 and so on. 

The kit numbers assigned by GEDmatch have been redacted out, to prevent reuse. 
The kits target.stripy.genome.(1-3) are the T1-T3, and target.stripy.genome.missing is target with missing genotypes Tmiss.
The 22stripy.genome.1 and 22stripy.genome.2 are the B1 and B2 baits using 22 heterozygous SNPs spread either side of the target SNP.
